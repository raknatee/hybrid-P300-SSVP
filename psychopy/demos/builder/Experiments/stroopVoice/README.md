# Stroop - measuring reaction times to incongruent stimuli

## The experiment: 
    
In this task subjects must speak the letters spelling each word, ignoring the word 
that they spell!

Note that PsychoPy can use various different "backends" to achieve the transcription. 
Locally you can use the engine that is built-in (called Sphinx CMU) but online you 
need either Google or Microsoft and, for that, you need a key from those sites.
