    <p>Basically, this application would compose with 3 components which are Frontend(GUI), ML service/server , and lastly EEG streaming client.</p>
    <h2>Docker</h2>
    <p>Frontend and ML service would be deployed on Docker container which are cool.Only EEG-client cannot because we want to connect EEG headset with Serial Port(USB). Serial Port could not (year 2021) work with Docker on Windows OS & Mac but it can work
        with Linux.</p>

    <h1>EEG streaming Client</h1>
    <p>This application needs someone(or thing) to stream EEG signal to our main core which is ML server.</p>
    <p>Normally, Open-BCI (EEG headset brand) has 2 types of EEG connecter that are Bluetooth and Wifi (I would call it White and Orange because of its color). Most researchers use LSL (Labstreaminglayer > <a href="https://labstreaminglayer.readthedocs.io/info/getting_started.html">click me for more information</a>        ) protocol to create a streaming pipeline which is based on TCP.The main objective of LSL is for data streaming over the local network. Therefore, I decided to use WS (Websocket) for this because it's more production mode.</p>
    <h2>Bluetooth (White)</h2>
    <p>I would create a WS over Serial connection. To stream the data to ML-server.
    </p>
    <h2>Wifi (Orange)</h2>
    <p>Currently (2021), Wifi module doesn't support.</p>

    <h1>Frontend</h1>
    <p>I decided to use Web (actually it is HTML canvas) for GUI.
